This app is a demonstration of an internal tool that can be used to calculate IRR for any property given a fixed set of inputs which can be customized as per user requirements.

Currently, it has a demonstration for a random property on the hosted link to better help understand what are the assuptions and how the IRR is affected when these assumptions change.
